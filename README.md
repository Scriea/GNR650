# GNR650

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the course GNR650 - Advanced Topics in Deep Learning for Image Analysis!. 
This is a collaborated repository between Ashutosh(200100037) and Utsav(200100054).


## [**Assignment 1**](./Task1/)

The primary objective of this task is to understand how a deep neural network behaves when trained with a limited amount of data, causing it to overfit the training set.
Subtasks involved:

  -  Train a ResNet18 on a small subset of the CIFAR-10 dataset (100 images per class) to intentionally induce overfitting
  -  Dive into the inner workings of the model by visualizing the learned convolutional kernels. By visualizing these kernels, you'll gain an understanding of the features the network learns to detect.
  -  Analyze the feature maps generated by intermediate layers of the network. This visualization will provide insights into the hierarchical representation of features throughout the network

### Misc.

  Tried to do the same for a bigger architecture - ResNet50.

## [**Assignment 2**](./Task2/)

The task is to analyze the performance of Visual Transformer Models (ViT) like _B12_, on both fine-tuned, and base models. We use **EuroSAT dataset** for training.

Subtasks involved:

  - Fine-tune final layer; Fine-tune bottom layers; Full fine-tune; Inference from pre-trained model.
  - Visualize feature maps and compare
